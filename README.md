# Decisore

This is the one and only to-do list app without bs and with stuff people actually need. The name is supposed to be read with Italian reading rules: Deh-chi-zo-reh.

### Our to-do list manifesto

#### Purpose
+ P1. The app should only be for personal use. No business should ever use it for work as a corporate tool (ewww).  
+ P2. The app should only be used for short-term objectives. "Read a book" can't be an objective. "Read chapter 1" can.  

#### Abilities
+ A1. The app should have an ability to add daily objectives. The app adds such objectives to the to-do list every day. Or every week, if it's weekly.  
+ A2. The app should have an ability to schedule objectives. The app adds them to the to-do list only on selected day.  
+ A3. The app should have an ability to add occasional objectives. Some things are both not daily and not one-shot - for example, checking the availability of a book. The app adds such objectives to the to-do list from time to time.  
+ A4. The app should have an ability to make objective chains. For example: "Make an appointment", "Go to a doctor". It's two objectives.  
+ A5. The app should have an ability to make objective pools. A pool contains several objective sources. The app picks an objective randomly from these sources, either periodically or on demand. Objective chains is an example of a such source.  
+ A6. The app should have an archive of objectives. The user can filter the archive by name, date range or objective type.  

#### Features
+ F1. The app should display unfinished objectives as a list.
+ F2. The list should look like a list. No boards-shmoards, diagrams or table. Once more: **The list looks like a list.**
+ F3. Nothing should divide the list. Every objective is a today objective.
+ F4. Every objective should have a checkbox. Once the user presses it, the objective moves to the archive. That's it, move on! If I pressed a checkbox, the objective stops being an eyesore.
+ F5. BS like time estimation, completion percent, priorities SHOULD ROT IN HELL.
+ F6. Objectives can have tags (why not?)
+ F7. Nothing should disrupt the inner peace. An objective turned a year today? Let it be. Didn't do daily objective yesterday? It happens. Nothing punishes the user except the user. AND NO DEADLINES, THE APP SHOULDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT WORD!
+ F8. Every daily objective can be paused, which stops it from appearing in the to-do list. Of course, every paused objective can be resumed.
+ F9. The user should be able to sort the list as they like. If the user wants to sort by date added, let them do it. If the user wants their favorite on the top, let them do it. If the user wants the objectives in random order, let them do it.
+ F10. Objective pools should have restrictions. For example, a chain may only give objective twice a day.


#### Corrections
+ C1. I said that priorities should rot in hell. Actually, something like "favorite objectives" can exist. But it only should influence its position in the list if the user wants it. And it should never force the user to do it first.
+ C2. I said that no business should ever use it as a corporate tool. First, if someone uses the app for work objectives by their own will, it's fine. But it should be their will, not their boss' will! Second, a completely distinct app can be used for corporate stuff. BUT NOTHING IN THE PERSONAL VERSION SHOULD REMIND THE USER OF WORK.

#### App work
+ W1. The app should be cloud-based. So I can open it at home, add a couple of objectives, go to a park and see the objectives there.
+ W2. The app should be accessible from: web/desktop, mobile.
+ W3. The app should have authorization (to sync the data). But it should work without any authorization, just via a local copy. The local copy synchronizes with the server after the first sign in.
+ W4. The app shouldn't be made by Google or Facebook.


If the app violates any of these, it's not good enough. This project aims to bring this manifesto to reality.
